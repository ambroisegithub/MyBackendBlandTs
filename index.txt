BodyParser:It processes incoming request bodies, making it easier to handle POST and PUT requests.
By parsing the body of an HTTP request and attaching it to the req. body property,
it simplifies data extraction and manipulation in server-side logic.


express is imported as the main framework for building the web application.

dotenv is imported to handle environment variables.

cors is imported to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.

helmet is imported to add security headers to HTTP responses.

The code checks if the PORT environment variable is defined. If not, a message is logged to the console.

The PORT variable is parsed from a string to an integer using parseInt().

An instance of the Express application is created using express() and assigned to the app variable.

Middleware functions are added to the Express application:

express.json() is used to parse JSON bodies of incoming requests.

express.urlencoded({extended : true}) is used to parse URL-encoded bodies of incoming requests.

cors() is used to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing.

helmet() is used to enhance the security of the application by setting various HTTP headers.
